Ask yourself this. The service, server, application, that you use and rely heavily on ... What libraries does it use?
An easy prediction to make is that the number of critical bugs found in small libraries, that is used Everywhere (like xz) is going to increase.

A move towards higher and higher level languages, because you just need stuff done, in a rush (because of deadlines, lack of personell etc etc) has been happening over the last decade...(few exceptions ofcourse exist)

Have thought about this for a while, and came up with a company idea.

Writing shit from scratch, in C or Python. No dependencies. No Libraries. Keeping them small, tidy and well documented code, for ease of reuse.
Write your own bugs. (Security by obscurity, kindof) Own them. Fix them.
By the end you will have a stack of libraries and applications you have written. Keep them opensource.

Who would pay though?
